## Introduction

This repository provides scripts for training LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) models with HunyuanVideo. This repository is unofficial and not affiliated with the official HunyanVideo repository.

*This repository is under development.*

### Recent Updates

- Jan 19, 2025
    - When pre-caching latents and Text Encoder outputs, files not included in the dataset are automatically deleted. This prevents unexpected files from being left behind and used in training.
        - You can still keep cache files as before by specifying `--keep_cache`.
    - Fixed an issue where specifying `--skip_existing` during pre-caching of Text Encoder outputs did not work correctly.

- Jan 18, 2025
    - Video2video inference is now possible with `hv_generate_video.py`. For details, please refer to [Inference](#inference).

- Jan 16, 2025
    - Added a script to merge LoRA weights, `merge_lora.py`. Thanks to kaykyr for PR [#37](https://github.com/kohya-ss/musubi-tuner/pull/37). For details, please refer to [Merging LoRA Weights](#merging-lora-weights).
    - Changed the sample training settings to a learning rate of 2e-4, `--timestep_sampling` to `shift`, and `--discrete_flow_shift` to 7.0. Faster training is expected. For details, please refer to [Training](#training).

- Jan 14, 2025
    - Added a temporary `--save_merged_model` option to `hv_generate_video.py` to save the DiT model after LoRA merge. For details, please refer to [Inference](#inference).

- Jan 13, 2025
    - Changed the settings for sample image/video generation to address the issue of blurry sample images/videos during training. For details, please refer to [this document](./docs/sampling_during_training.md).
        - You need to set the discrete flow shift and guidance scale correctly during inference, but the training settings were used as they were, causing this issue. We have set default values, which should improve the situation. You can specify the discrete flow shift with `--fs` and the guidance scale with `--g`.

### Releases

We are grateful to everyone who has been contributing to the Musubi Tuner ecosystem through documentation and third-party tools. To support these valuable contributions, we recommend working with our [releases](https://github.com/kohya-ss/musubi-tuner/releases) as stable reference points, as this project is under active development and breaking changes may occur.

You can find the latest release and version history in our [releases page](https://github.com/kohya-ss/musubi-tuner/releases).

## Overview

### Hardware Requirements

- VRAM: 12GB or more recommended for image training, 24GB or more for video training
    - *Actual requirements depend on resolution and training settings.* For 12GB, use a resolution of 960x544 or lower and use memory-saving options such as `--blocks_to_swap`, `--fp8_llm`, etc.
- Main Memory: 64GB or more recommended, 32GB + swap may work

### Features

- Memory-efficient implementation
- Windows compatibility confirmed (Linux compatibility confirmed by community)
- Multi-GPU support not implemented

## Installation

Python 3.10 or later is required (verified with 3.10).

Create a virtual environment and install PyTorch and torchvision matching your CUDA version. 

PyTorch 2.5.1 or later is required (see [note](#PyTorch-version)).

```bash
pip install torch torchvision --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu124
```

Install the required dependencies using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Optionally, you can use FlashAttention and SageAttention (for inference only; see [SageAttention Installation](#sageattention-installation) for installation instructions).

Optional dependencies for additional features:
- `ascii-magic`: Used for dataset verification
- `matplotlib`: Used for timestep visualization
- `tensorboard`: Used for logging training progress

```bash
pip install ascii-magic matplotlib tensorboard
```

## Model Download

There are two ways to download the model.

### Use the Official HunyuanVideo Model

Download the model following the [official README](https://github.com/Tencent/HunyuanVideo/blob/main/ckpts/README.md) and place it in your chosen directory with the following structure:

```
  ckpts
    ├──hunyuan-video-t2v-720p
    │  ├──transformers
    │  ├──vae
    ├──text_encoder
    ├──text_encoder_2
    ├──...
```

### Using ComfyUI Models for Text Encoder

This method is easier.

For DiT and VAE, use the HunyuanVideo models.

From https://huggingface.co/tencent/HunyuanVideo/tree/main/hunyuan-video-t2v-720p/transformers, download [mp_rank_00_model_states.pt](https://huggingface.co/tencent/HunyuanVideo/resolve/main/hunyuan-video-t2v-720p/transformers/mp_rank_00_model_states.pt) and place it in your chosen directory.

(Note: The fp8 model on the same page is unverified.)

If you are training with `--fp8_base`, you can use `mp_rank_00_model_states_fp8.safetensors` from [here](https://huggingface.co/kohya-ss/HunyuanVideo-fp8_e4m3fn-unofficial) instead of `mp_rank_00_model_states.pt`. (This file is unofficial and simply converts the weights to float8_e4m3fn.)

From https://huggingface.co/tencent/HunyuanVideo/tree/main/hunyuan-video-t2v-720p/vae, download [pytorch_model.pt](https://huggingface.co/tencent/HunyuanVideo/resolve/main/hunyuan-video-t2v-720p/vae/pytorch_model.pt) and place it in your chosen directory.

For the Text Encoder, use the models provided by ComfyUI. Refer to [ComfyUI's page](https://comfyanonymous.github.io/ComfyUI_examples/hunyuan_video/), from https://huggingface.co/Comfy-Org/HunyuanVideo_repackaged/tree/main/split_files/text_encoders, download `llava_llama3_fp16.safetensors` (Text Encoder 1, LLM) and `clip_l.safetensors` (Text Encoder 2, CLIP)  and place them in your chosen directory.

(Note: The fp8 LLM model on the same page is unverified.)

## Usage

### Dataset Configuration

Please refer to [dataset configuration guide](./dataset/dataset_config.md).

### Latent Pre-caching

Latent pre-caching is required. Create the cache using the following command:

```bash
python cache_latents.py --dataset_config path/to/toml --vae path/to/ckpts/hunyuan-video-t2v-720p/vae/pytorch_model.pt --vae_chunk_size 32 --vae_tiling
```

For additional options, use `python cache_latents.py --help`.

If you're running low on VRAM, reduce `--vae_spatial_tile_sample_min_size` to around 128 and lower the `--batch_size`.

Use `--debug_mode image` to display dataset images and captions in a new window, or `--debug_mode console` to display them in the console (requires `ascii-magic`).

By default, cache files not included in the dataset are automatically deleted. You can still keep cache files as before by specifying `--keep_cache`.

### Text Encoder Output Pre-caching

Text Encoder output pre-caching is required. Create the cache using the following command:

```bash
python cache_text_encoder_outputs.py --dataset_config path/to/toml  --text_encoder1 path/to/ckpts/text_encoder --text_encoder2 path/to/ckpts/text_encoder_2 --batch_size 16
```

For additional options, use `python cache_text_encoder_outputs.py --help`.

Adjust `--batch_size` according to your available VRAM.

For systems with limited VRAM (less than ~16GB), use `--fp8_llm` to run the LLM in fp8 mode.

By default, cache files not included in the dataset are automatically deleted. You can still keep cache files as before by specifying `--keep_cache`.

### Training

Start training using the following command (input as a single line):

```bash
accelerate launch --num_cpu_threads_per_process 1 --mixed_precision bf16 hv_train_network.py 
    --dit path/to/ckpts/hunyuan-video-t2v-720p/transformers/mp_rank_00_model_states.pt 
    --dataset_config path/to/toml --sdpa --mixed_precision bf16 --fp8_base 
    --optimizer_type adamw8bit --learning_rate 2e-4 --gradient_checkpointing 
    --max_data_loader_n_workers 2 --persistent_data_loader_workers 
    --network_module networks.lora --network_dim 32 
    --timestep_sampling shift --discrete_flow_shift 7.0 
    --max_train_epochs 16 --save_every_n_epochs 1 --seed 42
    --output_dir path/to/output_dir --output_name name-of-lora
```

__Update__: Changed the sample training settings to a learning rate of 2e-4, `--timestep_sampling` to `shift`, and `--discrete_flow_shift` to 7.0. Faster training is expected. If the details of the image are not learned well, try lowering the discete flow shift to around 3.0.

However, the training settings are still experimental. Appropriate learning rates, training steps, timestep distribution, loss weighting, etc. are not yet known. Feedback is welcome.

For additional options, use `python hv_train_network.py --help` (note that many options are unverified).

Specifying `--fp8_base` runs DiT in fp8 mode. Without this flag, mixed precision data type will be used. fp8 can significantly reduce memory consumption but may impact output quality. If `--fp8_base` is not specified, 24GB or more VRAM is recommended. Use `--blocks_to_swap` as needed.

If you're running low on VRAM, use `--blocks_to_swap` to offload some blocks to CPU. Maximum value is 36.

(The idea of block swap is based on the implementation by 2kpr. Thanks again to 2kpr.)

Use `--sdpa` for PyTorch's scaled dot product attention. Use `--flash_attn` for [FlashAttention](https://github.com/Dao-AILab/flash-attention). Use `--xformers` for xformers, but specify `--split_attn` when using xformers. Use `--sage_attn` for SageAttention, but SageAttention is not yet supported for training and will not work correctly.

`--split_attn` processes attention in chunks. Speed may be slightly reduced, but VRAM usage is slightly reduced.

The format of LoRA trained is the same as `sd-scripts`.

`--show_timesteps` can be set to `image` (requires `matplotlib`) or `console` to display timestep distribution and loss weighting during training.

For sample image generation during training, refer to [this document](./docs/sampling_during_training.md). For advanced configuration, refer to [this document](./docs/advanced_config.md).

### Merging LoRA Weights

```bash
python merge_lora.py \
    --dit path/to/ckpts/hunyuan-video-t2v-720p/transformers/mp_rank_00_model_states.pt \
    --lora_weight path/to/lora.safetensors \
    --save_merged_model path/to/merged_model.safetensors \
    --device cpu \
    --lora_multiplier 1.0
```

Specify the device to perform the calculation (`cpu` or `cuda`, etc.) with `--device`. Calculation will be faster if `cuda` is specified.

Specify the LoRA weights to merge with `--lora_weight` and the multiplier for the LoRA weights with `--lora_multiplier`. Multiple values can be specified, and the number of values must match.

### Inference

Generate videos using the following command:

```bash
python hv_generate_video.py --fp8 --video_size 544 960 --video_length 5 --infer_steps 30 
    --prompt "A cat walks on the grass, realistic style."  --save_path path/to/save/dir --output_type both 
    --dit path/to/ckpts/hunyuan-video-t2v-720p/transformers/mp_rank_00_model_states.pt --attn_mode sdpa --split_attn
    --vae path/to/ckpts/hunyuan-video-t2v-720p/vae/pytorch_model.pt 
    --vae_chunk_size 32 --vae_spatial_tile_sample_min_size 128 
    --text_encoder1 path/to/ckpts/text_encoder 
    --text_encoder2 path/to/ckpts/text_encoder_2 
    --seed 1234 --lora_multiplier 1.0 --lora_weight path/to/lora.safetensors
```

For additional options, use `python hv_generate_video.py --help`.

Specifying `--fp8` runs DiT in fp8 mode. fp8 can significantly reduce memory consumption but may impact output quality.

If you're running low on VRAM, use `--blocks_to_swap` to offload some blocks to CPU. Maximum value is 38.

For `--attn_mode`, specify either `flash`, `torch`, `sageattn`, `xformers`, or `sdpa` (same as `torch`). These correspond to FlashAttention, scaled dot product attention, SageAttention, and xformers, respectively. Default is `torch`. SageAttention is effective for VRAM reduction.

Specifing `--split_attn` will process attention in chunks. Inference with SageAttention is expected to be about 10% faster.

For `--output_type`, specify either `both`, `latent`, `video` or `images`. `both` outputs both latents and video. Recommended to use `both` in case of Out of Memory errors during VAE processing. You can specify saved latents with `--latent_path` and use `--output_type video` (or `images`) to only perform VAE decoding.

`--seed` is optional. A random seed will be used if not specified.

`--video_length` should be specified as "a multiple of 4 plus 1".

`--flow_shift` can be specified to shift the timestep (discrete flow shift). The default value when omitted is 7.0, which is the recommended value for 50 inference steps. In the HunyuanVideo paper, 7.0 is recommended for 50 steps, and 17.0 is recommended for less than 20 steps (e.g. 10).

By specifying `--video_path`, video2video inference is possible. Specify a video file or a directory containing multiple image files (the image files are sorted by file name and used as frames). An error will occur if the video is shorter than `--video_length`. You can specify the strength with `--strength`. It can be specified from 0 to 1.0, and the larger the value, the greater the change from the original video.

Note that video2video inference is experimental.

You can save the DiT model after LoRA merge with the `--save_merged_model` option. Specify `--save_merged_model path/to/merged_model.safetensors`. Note that inference will not be performed when this option is specified.

### Convert LoRA to another format

You can convert LoRA to a format compatible with ComfyUI (presumed to be Diffusion-pipe) using the following command:

```bash
python convert_lora.py --input path/to/musubi_lora.safetensors --output path/to/another_format.safetensors --target other
```

Specify the input and output file paths with `--input` and `--output`, respectively.

Specify `other` for `--target`. Use `default` to convert from another format to the format of this repository.

## Miscellaneous

### SageAttention Installation

sdbsd has provided a Windows-compatible SageAttention implementation and pre-built wheels here:  https://github.com/sdbds/SageAttention-for-windows. After installing triton, if your Python, PyTorch, and CUDA versions match, you can download and install the pre-built wheel from the [Releases](https://github.com/sdbds/SageAttention-for-windows/releases) page. Thanks to sdbsd for this contribution.

For reference, the build and installation instructions are as follows. You may need to update Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable to the latest version.

1. Download and install triton 3.1.0 wheel matching your Python version from [here](https://github.com/woct0rdho/triton-windows/releases/tag/v3.1.0-windows.post5).

2. Install Microsoft Visual Studio 2022 or Build Tools for Visual Studio 2022, configured for C++ builds.

3. Clone the SageAttention repository in your preferred directory:
    ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/thu-ml/SageAttention.git
    ```

    You can skip step 4 by using the sdbsd repository mentioned above by `git clone https://github.com/sdbds/SageAttention-for-windows.git`.

4. Open `math.cuh` in the `SageAttention/csrc` folder and change `ushort` to `unsigned short` on lines 71 and 146, then save.

5. Open `x64 Native Tools Command Prompt for VS 2022` from the Start menu under Visual Studio 2022.

6. Activate your venv, navigate to the SageAttention folder, and run the following command. If you get a DISTUTILS not configured error, set `set DISTUTILS_USE_SDK=1` and try again:
    ```shell
    python setup.py install
    ```

This completes the SageAttention installation.

### PyTorch version

If you specify `torch` for `--attn_mode`, use PyTorch 2.5.1 or later (earlier versions may result in black videos).

If you use an earlier version, use xformers or SageAttention.
