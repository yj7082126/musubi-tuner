### Recent Updates

- GitHub Discussions Enabled: We've enabled GitHub Discussions for community Q&A, knowledge sharing, and technical information exchange. Please use Issues for bug reports and feature requests, and Discussions for questions and sharing experiences. [Join the conversation →](https://github.com/kohya-ss/musubi-tuner/discussions)

- May 30, 2025:
    - Fixed a bug where the resizing of images and videos during dataset loading was not performed correctly. Please recreate the cache.  Thank you sdbds for PR [#312](https://github.com/kohya-ss/musubi-tuner/issues/312). 
        - The bug occurred when the width or height of the image before resizing matched the bucket's width or height, but the other dimension was different (for example, if the original image was 640x480 and the bucket was 640x360).
    - Updated the code for FramePack's one frame inference and training. The code has been significantly improved. See [FramePack's one frame inference documentation](./docs/framepack_1f.md) for details.
        - **Breaking change**: The dataset format, training options, and inference options for one frame training have changed. Please follow the documentation to update your dataset configuration, recreate the cache, and modify your training and inference options.
    - Added documentation for FramePack's one frame inference and training. See the [documentation](./docs/framepack_1f.md) for details.

- May 22, 2025:
    - In the inference script of FramePack, the following changes were made:
        - **Breaking change**: When saving images in one frame (single frame) inference, subdirectories are no longer created.
        - Added support for batch and interactive modes. In batch mode, prompts are read from a file and generated. In interactive mode, prompts are specified from the command line. See [FramePack documentation](./docs/framepack.md#batch-and-interactive-modes--バッチモードとインタラクティブモード) for details.
        - Added support for specifying multiple reference images in kisekaeichi method. See [FramePack documentation](./docs/framepack.md#kisekaeichi-method-history-reference-options--kisekaeichi方式履歴参照オプション) for details.

- May 17, 2025 update 1:
    - Fixed a bug where specifying `--max_data_loader_n_workers` as 2 or more caused data duplication or omission within a single epoch. PR [#287](https://github.com/kohya-ss/musubi-tuner/pull/287),  issue [#283](https://github.com/kohya-ss/musubi-tuner/issues/283)
        - In the long term, all data will be trained, but in the short term, data bias occurred.
        - The initialization of the dataset was inappropriate, causing each DataSet to return data in different orders, and this caused problems when using multiple DataLoaders. The initialization has been fixed so that all DataSets return data in the same order.

- May 17, 2025:
    - Added support for kisekaeichi method in FramePack's one frame inference. This new inference method proposed by furusu allows controlling the generated image by setting the reference image in post latent. See [FramePack documentation](./docs/framepack.md#kisekaeichi-method-history-reference-options--kisekaeichi方式履歴参照オプション) for details.

- May 11, 2025:
    - Added support for one frame training in FramePack. This is an experimental feature that allows training for one frame inference. See [FramePack documentation](./docs/framepack.md#single-frame-training--1フレーム学習) for details.

- May 9, 2025 update 2:
    - Added support for one frame inference in FramePack. This is a unique feature of this repository that generates an image after time progression according to the prompt, rather than a video. In other words, it allows limited natural language editing of images. See [FramePack documentation](./docs/framepack.md#single-frame-inference--単一フレーム推論) for details.
    - Added `--video_sections` option to specify the length of the generated video in terms of sections instead of seconds in the inference code of FramePack. Also added `--output_type latent_images` (saves both latent and images).

- May 9, 2025:
    - Added support for applying LoRA for HunyuanVideo in the inference code of FramePack. Both LoRA from this repository and diffusion-pipe can be applied. See [FramePack documentation](./docs/framepack.md#inference) for details.

- May 4, 2025:
    - Added training and inference for FramePack-F1 (experimental feature). See [FramePack documentation](./docs/framepack.md) for details. 
        - Please re-cache the latents for FramePack-F1 with `--f1` option (`--vanilla_sampling` is changed to `--f1`, and the behavior is changed). The cache files are not compatible with FramePack. The cache files cannot be shared between FramePack and FramePack-F1, so please specify a different `.toml` file for another cache directory. 

- May 1, 2025:
    - Added features to the inference code of FramePack, such as latent padding specification and custom prompt specification. See [FramePack documentation](./docs/framepack.md#inference) for details.
        - The behavior when specifying the section start image has changed (it no longer automatically sets latent padding to 0, so the start image is used as a reference image). To maintain the previous behavior (force the section start image), specify `--latent_padding 0,0,0,0` (specify 0 for each section).
        
- Apr 26, 2025:
    - Added inference and LoRA training for FramePack. PR [#230](https://github.com/kohya-ss/musubi-tuner/pull/230). See [FramePack documentation](./docs/framepack.md) for details.

- Apr 18, 2025:
    - Added batch generation mode that reads prompts from a file and generates them during Wan2.1 inference, as well as interactive mode that specifies prompts from the command line. See [here](./docs/wan.md#interactive-mode--インタラクティブモード) for details.


### Releases

We are grateful to everyone who has been contributing to the Musubi Tuner ecosystem through documentation and third-party tools. To support these valuable contributions, we recommend working with our [releases](https://github.com/kohya-ss/musubi-tuner/releases) as stable reference points, as this project is under active development and breaking changes may occur.

You can find the latest release and version history in our [releases page](https://github.com/kohya-ss/musubi-tuner/releases).

## Overview

### Hardware Requirements

- VRAM: 12GB or more recommended for image training, 24GB or more for video training
    - *Actual requirements depend on resolution and training settings.* For 12GB, use a resolution of 960x544 or lower and use memory-saving options such as `--blocks_to_swap`, `--fp8_llm`, etc.
- Main Memory: 64GB or more recommended, 32GB + swap may work

### Features

- Memory-efficient implementation
- Windows compatibility confirmed (Linux compatibility confirmed by community)
- Multi-GPU support not implemented

## Installation

### pip based installation

Python 3.10 or later is required (verified with 3.10).

Create a virtual environment and install PyTorch and torchvision matching your CUDA version. 

PyTorch 2.5.1 or later is required (see [note](#PyTorch-version)).

```bash
pip install torch torchvision --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu124
```

Install the required dependencies using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Optionally, you can use FlashAttention and SageAttention (**for inference only**; see [SageAttention Installation](#sageattention-installation) for installation instructions).

Optional dependencies for additional features:
- `ascii-magic`: Used for dataset verification
- `matplotlib`: Used for timestep visualization
- `tensorboard`: Used for logging training progress

```bash
pip install ascii-magic matplotlib tensorboard
```

### uv based installation (experimenal)

You can also install using uv, but installation with uv is experimental. Feedback is welcome.

1. Install uv (if not already present on your OS).

#### Linux/MacOS

```sh
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

Follow the instructions to add the uv path manually until you restart your session...

#### Windows

```powershell
powershell -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
```

Follow the instructions to add the uv path manually until you reboot your system... or just reboot your system at this point.

## Model Download

There are two ways to download the model.

### Use the Official HunyuanVideo Model

Download the model following the [official README](https://github.com/Tencent/HunyuanVideo/blob/main/ckpts/README.md) and place it in your chosen directory with the following structure:

```
  ckpts
    ├──hunyuan-video-t2v-720p
    │  ├──transformers
    │  ├──vae
    ├──text_encoder
    ├──text_encoder_2
    ├──...
```

### Using ComfyUI Models for Text Encoder

This method is easier.

For DiT and VAE, use the HunyuanVideo models.

From https://huggingface.co/tencent/HunyuanVideo/tree/main/hunyuan-video-t2v-720p/transformers, download [mp_rank_00_model_states.pt](https://huggingface.co/tencent/HunyuanVideo/resolve/main/hunyuan-video-t2v-720p/transformers/mp_rank_00_model_states.pt) and place it in your chosen directory.

(Note: The fp8 model on the same page is unverified.)

If you are training with `--fp8_base`, you can use `mp_rank_00_model_states_fp8.safetensors` from [here](https://huggingface.co/kohya-ss/HunyuanVideo-fp8_e4m3fn-unofficial) instead of `mp_rank_00_model_states.pt`. (This file is unofficial and simply converts the weights to float8_e4m3fn.)

From https://huggingface.co/tencent/HunyuanVideo/tree/main/hunyuan-video-t2v-720p/vae, download [pytorch_model.pt](https://huggingface.co/tencent/HunyuanVideo/resolve/main/hunyuan-video-t2v-720p/vae/pytorch_model.pt) and place it in your chosen directory.

For the Text Encoder, use the models provided by ComfyUI. Refer to [ComfyUI's page](https://comfyanonymous.github.io/ComfyUI_examples/hunyuan_video/), from https://huggingface.co/Comfy-Org/HunyuanVideo_repackaged/tree/main/split_files/text_encoders, download `llava_llama3_fp16.safetensors` (Text Encoder 1, LLM) and `clip_l.safetensors` (Text Encoder 2, CLIP)  and place them in your chosen directory.

(Note: The fp8 LLM model on the same page is unverified.)

## Usage

### Dataset Configuration

Please refer to [dataset configuration guide](./dataset/dataset_config.md).

### Latent Pre-caching

Latent pre-caching is required. Create the cache using the following command:

If you have installed using pip:

```bash
python cache_latents.py --dataset_config path/to/toml --vae path/to/ckpts/hunyuan-video-t2v-720p/vae/pytorch_model.pt --vae_chunk_size 32 --vae_tiling
```

If you have installed with `uv`, you can use `uv run` to run the script. Other scripts can be run in the same way. (Note that the installation with `uv` is experimental. Feedback is welcome. If you encounter any issues, please use the pip-based installation.)

```bash
uv run cache_latents.py --dataset_config path/to/toml --vae path/to/ckpts/hunyuan-video-t2v-720p/vae/pytorch_model.pt --vae_chunk_size 32 --vae_tiling
```

For additional options, use `python cache_latents.py --help`.

If you're running low on VRAM, reduce `--vae_spatial_tile_sample_min_size` to around 128 and lower the `--batch_size`.

Use `--debug_mode image` to display dataset images and captions in a new window, or `--debug_mode console` to display them in the console (requires `ascii-magic`). 

With `--debug_mode video`, images or videos will be saved in the cache directory (please delete them after checking). The bitrate of the saved video is set to 1Mbps for preview purposes. The images decoded from the original video (not degraded) are used for the cache (for training).

When `--debug_mode` is specified, the actual caching process is not performed.

By default, cache files not included in the dataset are automatically deleted. You can still keep cache files as before by specifying `--keep_cache`.

### Text Encoder Output Pre-caching

Text Encoder output pre-caching is required. Create the cache using the following command:

```bash
python cache_text_encoder_outputs.py --dataset_config path/to/toml  --text_encoder1 path/to/ckpts/text_encoder --text_encoder2 path/to/ckpts/text_encoder_2 --batch_size 16
```

or for uv:

```bash
uv run cache_text_encoder_outputs.py --dataset_config path/to/toml  --text_encoder1 path/to/ckpts/text_encoder --text_encoder2 path/to/ckpts/text_encoder_2 --batch_size 16
```

For additional options, use `python cache_text_encoder_outputs.py --help`.

Adjust `--batch_size` according to your available VRAM.

For systems with limited VRAM (less than ~16GB), use `--fp8_llm` to run the LLM in fp8 mode.

By default, cache files not included in the dataset are automatically deleted. You can still keep cache files as before by specifying `--keep_cache`.

### Configuration of Accelerate

Run `accelerate config` to configure Accelerate. Choose appropriate values for each question based on your environment (either input values directly or use arrow keys and enter to select; uppercase is default, so if the default value is fine, just press enter without inputting anything). For training with a single GPU, answer the questions as follows:


```txt
- In which compute environment are you running?: This machine
- Which type of machine are you using?: No distributed training
- Do you want to run your training on CPU only (even if a GPU / Apple Silicon / Ascend NPU device is available)?[yes/NO]: NO
- Do you wish to optimize your script with torch dynamo?[yes/NO]: NO
- Do you want to use DeepSpeed? [yes/NO]: NO
- What GPU(s) (by id) should be used for training on this machine as a comma-seperated list? [all]: all
- Would you like to enable numa efficiency? (Currently only supported on NVIDIA hardware). [yes/NO]: NO
- Do you wish to use mixed precision?: bf16
```

*Note*: In some cases, you may encounter the error `ValueError: fp16 mixed precision requires a GPU`. If this happens, answer "0" to the sixth question (`What GPU(s) (by id) should be used for training on this machine as a comma-separated list? [all]:`). This means that only the first GPU (id `0`) will be used.

### Training

Start training using the following command (input as a single line):

```bash
accelerate launch --num_cpu_threads_per_process 1 --mixed_precision bf16 hv_train_network.py 
    --dit path/to/ckpts/hunyuan-video-t2v-720p/transformers/mp_rank_00_model_states.pt 
    --dataset_config path/to/toml --sdpa --mixed_precision bf16 --fp8_base 
    --optimizer_type adamw8bit --learning_rate 2e-4 --gradient_checkpointing 
    --max_data_loader_n_workers 2 --persistent_data_loader_workers 
    --network_module networks.lora --network_dim 32 
    --timestep_sampling shift --discrete_flow_shift 7.0 
    --max_train_epochs 16 --save_every_n_epochs 1 --seed 42
    --output_dir path/to/output_dir --output_name name-of-lora
```

or for uv:

```bash
uv run accelerate launch --num_cpu_threads_per_process 1 --mixed_precision bf16 hv_train_network.py 
    --dit path/to/ckpts/hunyuan-video-t2v-720p/transformers/mp_rank_00_model_states.pt 
    --dataset_config path/to/toml --sdpa --mixed_precision bf16 --fp8_base 
    --optimizer_type adamw8bit --learning_rate 2e-4 --gradient_checkpointing 
    --max_data_loader_n_workers 2 --persistent_data_loader_workers 
    --network_module networks.lora --network_dim 32 
    --timestep_sampling shift --discrete_flow_shift 7.0 
    --max_train_epochs 16 --save_every_n_epochs 1 --seed 42
    --output_dir path/to/output_dir --output_name name-of-lora
```

__Update__: Changed the sample training settings to a learning rate of 2e-4, `--timestep_sampling` to `shift`, and `--discrete_flow_shift` to 7.0. Faster training is expected. If the details of the image are not learned well, try lowering the discete flow shift to around 3.0.

However, the training settings are still experimental. Appropriate learning rates, training steps, timestep distribution, loss weighting, etc. are not yet known. Feedback is welcome.

For additional options, use `python hv_train_network.py --help` (note that many options are unverified).

Specifying `--fp8_base` runs DiT in fp8 mode. Without this flag, mixed precision data type will be used. fp8 can significantly reduce memory consumption but may impact output quality. If `--fp8_base` is not specified, 24GB or more VRAM is recommended. Use `--blocks_to_swap` as needed.

If you're running low on VRAM, use `--blocks_to_swap` to offload some blocks to CPU. Maximum value is 36.

(The idea of block swap is based on the implementation by 2kpr. Thanks again to 2kpr.)

Use `--sdpa` for PyTorch's scaled dot product attention. Use `--flash_attn` for [FlashAttention](https://github.com/Dao-AILab/flash-attention). Use `--xformers` for xformers, but specify `--split_attn` when using xformers. `--sage_attn` for SageAttention, but SageAttention is not yet supported for training, so it raises a ValueError.

`--split_attn` processes attention in chunks. Speed may be slightly reduced, but VRAM usage is slightly reduced.

The format of LoRA trained is the same as `sd-scripts`.

`--show_timesteps` can be set to `image` (requires `matplotlib`) or `console` to display timestep distribution and loss weighting during training.

You can record logs during training. Refer to [Save and view logs in TensorBoard format](./docs/advanced_config.md#save-and-view-logs-in-tensorboard-format--tensorboard形式のログの保存と参照).

For PyTorch Dynamo optimization, refer to [this document](./docs/advanced_config.md#pytorch-dynamo-optimization-for-model-training--モデルの学習におけるpytorch-dynamoの最適化).

For sample image generation during training, refer to [this document](./docs/sampling_during_training.md). For advanced configuration, refer to [this document](./docs/advanced_config.md).

### Merging LoRA Weights

Note: Wan2.1 is not supported for merging LoRA weights.

```bash
python merge_lora.py \
    --dit path/to/ckpts/hunyuan-video-t2v-720p/transformers/mp_rank_00_model_states.pt \
    --lora_weight path/to/lora.safetensors \
    --save_merged_model path/to/merged_model.safetensors \
    --device cpu \
    --lora_multiplier 1.0
```

or for uv:

```bash
uv run merge_lora.py \
    --dit path/to/ckpts/hunyuan-video-t2v-720p/transformers/mp_rank_00_model_states.pt \
    --lora_weight path/to/lora.safetensors \
    --save_merged_model path/to/merged_model.safetensors \
    --device cpu \
    --lora_multiplier 1.0
```

Specify the device to perform the calculation (`cpu` or `cuda`, etc.) with `--device`. Calculation will be faster if `cuda` is specified.

Specify the LoRA weights to merge with `--lora_weight` and the multiplier for the LoRA weights with `--lora_multiplier`. Multiple values can be specified, and the number of values must match.

### Inference

Generate videos using the following command:

```bash
python hv_generate_video.py --fp8 --video_size 544 960 --video_length 5 --infer_steps 30 
    --prompt "A cat walks on the grass, realistic style."  --save_path path/to/save/dir --output_type both 
    --dit path/to/ckpts/hunyuan-video-t2v-720p/transformers/mp_rank_00_model_states.pt --attn_mode sdpa --split_attn
    --vae path/to/ckpts/hunyuan-video-t2v-720p/vae/pytorch_model.pt 
    --vae_chunk_size 32 --vae_spatial_tile_sample_min_size 128 
    --text_encoder1 path/to/ckpts/text_encoder 
    --text_encoder2 path/to/ckpts/text_encoder_2 
    --seed 1234 --lora_multiplier 1.0 --lora_weight path/to/lora.safetensors
```

or for uv:

```bash
uv run hv_generate_video.py --fp8 --video_size 544 960 --video_length 5 --infer_steps 30 
    --prompt "A cat walks on the grass, realistic style."  --save_path path/to/save/dir --output_type both 
    --dit path/to/ckpts/hunyuan-video-t2v-720p/transformers/mp_rank_00_model_states.pt --attn_mode sdpa --split_attn
    --vae path/to/ckpts/hunyuan-video-t2v-720p/vae/pytorch_model.pt 
    --vae_chunk_size 32 --vae_spatial_tile_sample_min_size 128 
    --text_encoder1 path/to/ckpts/text_encoder 
    --text_encoder2 path/to/ckpts/text_encoder_2 
    --seed 1234 --lora_multiplier 1.0 --lora_weight path/to/lora.safetensors
```

For additional options, use `python hv_generate_video.py --help`.

Specifying `--fp8` runs DiT in fp8 mode. fp8 can significantly reduce memory consumption but may impact output quality.

`--fp8_fast` option is also available for faster inference on RTX 40x0 GPUs. This option requires `--fp8` option. 

If you're running low on VRAM, use `--blocks_to_swap` to offload some blocks to CPU. Maximum value is 38.

For `--attn_mode`, specify either `flash`, `torch`, `sageattn`, `xformers`, or `sdpa` (same as `torch`). These correspond to FlashAttention, scaled dot product attention, SageAttention, and xformers, respectively. Default is `torch`. SageAttention is effective for VRAM reduction.

Specifing `--split_attn` will process attention in chunks. Inference with SageAttention is expected to be about 10% faster.

For `--output_type`, specify either `both`, `latent`, `video` or `images`. `both` outputs both latents and video. Recommended to use `both` in case of Out of Memory errors during VAE processing. You can specify saved latents with `--latent_path` and use `--output_type video` (or `images`) to only perform VAE decoding.

`--seed` is optional. A random seed will be used if not specified.

`--video_length` should be specified as "a multiple of 4 plus 1".

`--flow_shift` can be specified to shift the timestep (discrete flow shift). The default value when omitted is 7.0, which is the recommended value for 50 inference steps. In the HunyuanVideo paper, 7.0 is recommended for 50 steps, and 17.0 is recommended for less than 20 steps (e.g. 10).

By specifying `--video_path`, video2video inference is possible. Specify a video file or a directory containing multiple image files (the image files are sorted by file name and used as frames). An error will occur if the video is shorter than `--video_length`. You can specify the strength with `--strength`. It can be specified from 0 to 1.0, and the larger the value, the greater the change from the original video.

Note that video2video inference is experimental.

`--compile` option enables PyTorch's compile feature (experimental). Requires triton. On Windows, also requires Visual C++ build tools installed and PyTorch>=2.6.0 (Visual C++ build tools is also required). You can pass arguments to the compiler with `--compile_args`.

The `--compile` option takes a long time to run the first time, but speeds up on subsequent runs.

You can save the DiT model after LoRA merge with the `--save_merged_model` option. Specify `--save_merged_model path/to/merged_model.safetensors`. Note that inference will not be performed when this option is specified.

### Inference with SkyReels V1

SkyReels V1 T2V and I2V models are supported (inference only). 

The model can be downloaded from [here](https://huggingface.co/Kijai/SkyReels-V1-Hunyuan_comfy). Many thanks to Kijai for providing the model. `skyreels_hunyuan_i2v_bf16.safetensors` is the I2V model, and `skyreels_hunyuan_t2v_bf16.safetensors` is the T2V model. The models other than bf16 are not tested (`fp8_e4m3fn` may work).

For T2V inference, add the following options to the inference command:

```bash
--guidance_scale 6.0 --embedded_cfg_scale 1.0 --negative_prompt "Aerial view, aerial view, overexposed, low quality, deformation, a poor composition, bad hands, bad teeth, bad eyes, bad limbs, distortion" --split_uncond
```

SkyReels V1 seems to require a classfier free guidance (negative prompt).`--guidance_scale` is a guidance scale for the negative prompt. The recommended value is 6.0 from the official repository. The default is 1.0, it means no classifier free guidance.

`--embedded_cfg_scale` is a scale of the embedded guidance. The recommended value is 1.0 from the official repository (it may mean no embedded guidance).

`--negative_prompt` is a negative prompt for the classifier free guidance. The above sample is from the official repository. If you don't specify this, and specify `--guidance_scale` other than 1.0, an empty string will be used as the negative prompt.

`--split_uncond` is a flag to split the model call into unconditional and conditional parts. This reduces VRAM usage but may slow down inference. If `--split_attn` is specified, `--split_uncond` is automatically set.

You can also perform image2video inference with SkyReels V1 I2V model. Specify the image file path with `--image_path`. The image will be resized to the given `--video_size`.

```bash
--image_path path/to/image.jpg
``` 

### Convert LoRA to another format

You can convert LoRA to a format compatible with ComfyUI (presumed to be Diffusion-pipe) using the following command:

```bash
python convert_lora.py --input path/to/musubi_lora.safetensors --output path/to/another_format.safetensors --target other
```

or for uv:

```bash
uv run convert_lora.py --input path/to/musubi_lora.safetensors --output path/to/another_format.safetensors --target other
```

Specify the input and output file paths with `--input` and `--output`, respectively.

Specify `other` for `--target`. Use `default` to convert from another format to the format of this repository.

Wan2.1 is also supported. 

## Miscellaneous

### SageAttention Installation

sdbsd has provided a Windows-compatible SageAttention implementation and pre-built wheels here:  https://github.com/sdbds/SageAttention-for-windows. After installing triton, if your Python, PyTorch, and CUDA versions match, you can download and install the pre-built wheel from the [Releases](https://github.com/sdbds/SageAttention-for-windows/releases) page. Thanks to sdbsd for this contribution.

For reference, the build and installation instructions are as follows. You may need to update Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable to the latest version.

1. Download and install triton 3.1.0 wheel matching your Python version from [here](https://github.com/woct0rdho/triton-windows/releases/tag/v3.1.0-windows.post5).

2. Install Microsoft Visual Studio 2022 or Build Tools for Visual Studio 2022, configured for C++ builds.

3. Clone the SageAttention repository in your preferred directory:
    ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/thu-ml/SageAttention.git
    ```

4. Open `x64 Native Tools Command Prompt for VS 2022` from the Start menu under Visual Studio 2022.

5. Activate your venv, navigate to the SageAttention folder, and run the following command. If you get a DISTUTILS not configured error, set `set DISTUTILS_USE_SDK=1` and try again:
    ```shell
    python setup.py install
    ```

This completes the SageAttention installation.

### PyTorch version

If you specify `torch` for `--attn_mode`, use PyTorch 2.5.1 or later (earlier versions may result in black videos).

If you use an earlier version, use xformers or SageAttention.
